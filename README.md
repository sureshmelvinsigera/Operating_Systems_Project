## About

This module/exercise gives students hands-on experience setting up and configuring workstations. The scenario is that you are a system administrator for a small school. You have been tasked with setting up workstations for the students. The school has chosen to use Ubuntu Linux for their computer labs as it is open source, well-maintained, and can be properly secured. The students will need to print assignments to a network printer, access the internet, use a word processor, draw graphics, and during recess, play appropriate games.
